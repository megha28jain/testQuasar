        <h5>FAQs</h5><br/>
        <b>Why is there no life science VC in this financial round?</b><br/><br/>
        With Hemex we actually have a specialized investor in this field, which already invested in the previous round. Hemex are experts in regulatory affairs and their CEO Pascal Winnen is also our Chairman of the Board. But it is true that our current cap table is dominated by technology investors. This will change as we get closer to clinical development of IVDs. And for the Series A we're already in talks with Life Science VCs, including some from the US. We want to broaden our network in biotech and diagonistics, also in view to prepare an exit strategy.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>What are the preconditions for an exit?</b><br/><br/>
        We need to further validate our platform technology with more use cases. The second goal is getting commercial traction by entering licencing agreements.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>When deciding which biomarkers you want to look for next, which criteria do you apply?</b><br/><br/>
        First of all we'll stay in the field of oncology. We're looking for cases where there is a medical need and the discovery of a new biiomarker can significantly change the patient journey. There also needs to be a high enough number of patients so that it represents a significant commercial potential. Last but not least we ask ourselves the question if the project seems biologically feasible, which means there must be signs that a signle-cell profile could be useful.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>Why do you develop your own machine learning algorithms and not just use one that is available off the shell?</b><br/><br/>
        The domain-specific knowledge of the alogorithms is very important in our case because we work with smaller sizes, while image recognition algorithms can be trained with millions of images. Equally important is the setup of the studies as a machine learning algorithm is only as good as the data that goes into it.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>Could large pharma companies become your competitors one day?</b><br/><br/>
        We are actually collaborating with pharma firms because they see us as an interesting partner that can enlarge their diagonistics portfolio. And we're happy to work with them since clinical validation of an IVD is expensive and can cost 2 million, so we want to share these development costs with them. The typical commercial model is that we get an upfront payment that covers the development cost and then royalities on net sales of the diagonistic.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
